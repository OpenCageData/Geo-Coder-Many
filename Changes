Revision history for Perl module Geo::Coder::Many.


0.20    23 Feb 2011
        - support new Geo::Coder::Googlev3 response format
        - require Geo::Coder::Googlev3 0.06
        - change to precision scoring in 
          Geo::Coder::Many::Utils::determine_precision_from_bbox

0.20    22 Feb 2011
        - added Geo::Coder::Many::Googlev3
        - fixed bug in causing division by zero error
          when creating default (WRR) scheduler without weights

0.19    5 Jan 2011
        - added Geo::Coder::Many::Ovi
        - added link to Dec 2010 London Perl Workshop talk in POD
        - fixed typo in Geo::Coder::Many::SimpleGeo
        - require Test::Simple, not Test::More

0.18    3 Dec 2010
        - return undef when precision is unknown as per pod,
          had previously been returning 1 from SimpleGeo and Mapquest

0.17    3 Dec 2010
        - added support for SimpleGeo with Geo::Coder::Many::SimpleGeo
        - made Geo::Coder::Many::get_geocoders() public, fixed pod
        - hid pod for internal methods. Don't play with internals!

0.16    3 Dec 2010
        - added Geo::Coder::Many::Mapquest, though still need to 
          add precision
        - pod tweaks

0.15    11 Nov 2010
        - Geo::Coder::Many::Google assumed google geocoding api v3
          when in reality v2 is used. This is now fixed. 

          Have tried to contact author of Geo::Coder::Google about
          supporting v3
   
0.14    8 Nov 2010
        - fixed mix up of long and lat in in Geo::Coder::Many::Bing
          thx to stpra123 for reporting
        - previously Geo::Coder::Many::Google had been returning precision
          of 1.0 for all requests (what a wonderful world that would be)
          Now determines precision based on response
        - previously Geo::Coder::Many::OSM had been returning precision 
          of undef for all requests (what a terrible world that would be)
          Now determines precision based on response
        - both of the above use 
          Geo::Coder::Many::Util::determine_precision_from_bbox
          which use Geo::Distance::XS
        - new tests
        - submitted by co-maintainer EDF
        - corresponds to Lokku internal revision 39083
