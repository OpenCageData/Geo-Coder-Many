=head1 NAME

Scheduler

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Abstract base class for schedulers. Should not be instantiated directly.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Should never be called; subclasses should override.

=cut

sub new { croak "Scheduler should not be instantiated directly: use a subclass."; }

=head2 get_next_unique

get_next_unique should return the next scheduled item, according to whatever
scheduling scheme the subclass implements. The same item should *not* be
returned more than once between calls to reset_available.

=cut

sub get_next_unique { die "get_next_unique must be overridden."; }

=head2 next_available

If there are items in the scheduler that have not already been dispensed since
the last call to 'reset_available', next_available should return the minimum
amount of time (in floating seconds) until one of them might become available. 

If there will never be any such items available, it should return -1.

In Geo::Coder::Many, next_available is used to tell the result-picker
whether it is worth waiting for more results.

=cut

sub next_available { die "next_available must be overridden."; }

=head2 reset_available

This is called in order to indicate that all items should once more be made available.

=cut

sub reset_available { die "reset_available must be overridden."; }

=head2 process_feedback

This is called to provide information about the performance of a geocoder. Does nothing by default.

=cut

sub process_feedback { return; }

1;
